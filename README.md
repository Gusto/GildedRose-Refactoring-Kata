## Forked from [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

Forked to run workshops using the Kata.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo (`git clone git@github.com:wenley/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.git`)
2. Make sure you have the `rspec` gem installed (`gem install rspec`)
3. Run the specs (`rspec ruby/gilded_rose_spec.rb`)
4. Read the [instructions](https://github.com/wenley/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt)
5. Implement the currently skipped tests!

Hint: You may want to do some refactoring before implementing the behavior for the skipped tests.

#### Note: Tests are provided

Part of the original exercise is figuring out what tests to add, but that would take more time than we have.

If you want to give a shot at writing your own tests, feel free to do so on your own time! You can clone the original repo and get started from there.
